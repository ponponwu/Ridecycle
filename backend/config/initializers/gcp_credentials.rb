# config/initializers/gcp_credentials.rb
# 
# This file has been removed as part of AWS S3 migration.
# Google Cloud Storage credentials are no longer needed.
# 
# AWS S3 credentials should be provided via environment variables:
# - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
# - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# - AWS_REGION
# - AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME
# - AWS_S3_DEV_BUCKET_NAME (for development)
#
# For production deployment, consider using IAM roles instead of access keys.
